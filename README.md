Judul: Aplikasi Kriptografi Diffie Hellman - Autokey Vigenère

Developed a GUI-based cryptography application using Python and CustomTkinter as a final project for the Cryptography subject.
The application implements secure key exchange using the Diffie-Hellman protocol and applies the resulting symmetric key for message encryption and decryption using the Autokey Vigenère cipher.

Key features:
• Prime number and primitive root generator modules.
• Diffie-Hellman key exchange simulation between two users.
• Key conversion and symmetric encryption using the Autokey Vigenère method.
• Real-time GUI interface with input validation and interactive encryption/decryption.
• Includes user guide and multi-tab navigation.
